## Rain Prediction

In this project, I will try to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based the past weather data using binary classification models. I have used models like logistic regression and Decision Tree to check and compare their performances. 


### Dataset
For this project, I have used [weatherAUS from kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trisha2094/weatheraus)


### Machine Learning Model
For this project, I have used Logistic Regression and Decision Tree model. The target variable to be predicted is “RainTomorrow” meaning whether it will rain the next day or not.  Yes indicates it will rain tomorrow whereas, No means no rain.
